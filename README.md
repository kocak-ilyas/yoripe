# Hello Mohamed hope you are doing well.
Task done which has usable filter (Popular, Auction, Flat-rate, Scheduled) and Search Bar.
Popular badge covers more than 8000 by filtering and sorts from higher to lower number.
Auction, Flat-rate, Scheduled badges filters according to "salesMethod" parameter in api.
I added a badge to card of product so that the filters can be viewed better.

To search for the product name, start typing in the search bar, not need to submit button.
I use private ".env" file but I added ".env.example" file in GitHub which has REACT_APP_baseURL because maybe you want to check data of api (https://app.apiary.io/kocakilyas/)
